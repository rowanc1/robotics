    "## Characteristics of Robot Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the above action representations share a few common characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, actions have local effects, both spatially and temporally.\n",
    "Actions are executed *here* and *now* and their effects are immediate.\n",
    "This is perhaps most obvious for continuous time systems, in which actions affect the\n",
    "time derivative of the system trajectory. \n",
    "This local nature of actions brings a significant computational benefit.\n",
    "Planners need not worry about the entire state of the world over the entire time history\n",
    "of execution. Rather, planners can focus on building plans one step at a time,\n",
    "constructing a sequence of local changes that ultimately bring about the desired world\n",
    "state.\n",
    "Furthermore, this local property allows us to simplify the descriptions of\n",
    "actions, including only those aspects of the world that spatially relevant.\n",
    "Note, for example, that the precondition for picking up a block depends\n",
    "only on what is immediately on top of the block, not on the arrangement of other\n",
    "blocks that might be on the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second characteristic of the actions described above is that the do not include any consideration\n",
    "of uncertainty.\n",
    "In real-world robotics problems, the robot rarely knows the exact state of the world,\n",
    "and it cannot predict with certainty the effects of its own actions on the world.\n",
    "To cope with such uncertainties, we often use probability theory to model the effects\n",
    "of actions.\n",
    "For example, if the action is to move one space to the left in a grid, we might model\n",
    "the action as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(x_t, \\mathrm{left})\n",
    "        = \\left[\\begin{array}{c}r_{t} \\\\ c_{t} - 1 + w_t \\end{array}\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "in which $w_t$ represents an unknown disturbance.  If we can say something about\n",
    "the probability distribution for $w_t$, for example that $w_t \\in \\{ -1, 0 , 1\\}$ and\n",
    "that all outcomes are equally probably, \n",
    "then\n",
    "we can use probability theory to reason about which actions to apply to maximize\n",
