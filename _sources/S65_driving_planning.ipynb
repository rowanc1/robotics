    "To this point, we have considered two approaches for quantifying motions.\n",
    "For all of our probabilistic methods, we used a discrete time formulation and considered\n",
    "the effects of executing an action (e.g., move forward, move left) for a small duration of time, $\\Delta t$.\n",

    "use short straight-line paths in the configuration space to connect configurations (small gradient descent\n",
    "steps for potential fields, and steering toward $q_\\mathrm{rand}$ for RRTs).\n",

    "This approach can be very inefficient for planning long trajectories that have well-defined\n",

    "## Planning using Motion Primitives\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of motion primitives can greatly reduce the cost of planning, since the set \n",
    "of actions available at any moment in time is small and easily computed.\n",
    "For the car example above, if we assume a symmetric set of motion primitives for veering to the right,\n",
    "motion planning can be reduced to choosing from this set of seven possible actions at each moment in time.\n",
    "If, for example, there is a slow moving car just ahead, it might be advantageous to change lanes using one of\n",
    "$P_2$, $P_3$, or $P_4$.\n",
    "If there is a rapidly approaching oncoming car, it might be best to use $P_2$, to delay changing lanes\n",
    "until that car has passed by.\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, a motion primitive typically includes a set of conditions that define when\n",
    "the primitive is applicable, and a set of possible transitions to other motion primitives.\n",
    "For example, it would be reasonable to veer left slightly and then drive straight, but it would\n",
    "not be reasonable to transition from forward motion to reverse motion without some intermediate\n",
    "maneuvering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under these conditions, planning can be effected by a generate-and-test approach.\n",
    "At each moment in time, the planner considers the current situation, enumerates the valid\n",
    "motion primitives (using preconditions for execution and set of valid transitions), and evaluates\n",
    "the benefit of each admissible candidate motion primitive. This approach can be effective for\n",
    "problems such as highway driving, where local context is all that is necessary for making decisions.\n",
    "For example, the traffic outside the Atlanta perimeter is irrelevant when leaving the downtown on\n",
    "a trip to Chicago.\n",
    "In this case, immediate driving decisions depend on the car just ahead, and the nearby\n",
    "cars in adjacent lanes."
