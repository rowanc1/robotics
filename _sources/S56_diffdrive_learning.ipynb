    "A neural network output, and in particular a CNN, depends on the large set of continuous weights $W$ that make up its convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. When we train a neural networks, we adjust its weights $W$ to perform better on the task at hand, be it classification or regression. To measure whether the model performs \"better\", we find a **loss function**. To adjust the weights, we calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to each of the weights, and adjust the weights accordingly. That procedure is called **gradient descent**."

    "\n",
    "Stochastic gradient descent is an approximate gradient descent procedure, to cope with the very large data sets typically thrown at supervised problems. It is typically impossible to calculate the *exact* gradient, which requires looping over all the examples, which can run in the millions (or billions). An easy approximation scheme is to *randomly sample* a small subset of the examples, and calculate the gradient of the weights using only those examples. The upside is that this is much faster, but the downside is that this is only approximate. Hence, if we adjust weights with this approximate gradient, we might or might not make progress on the task. This procedure is called **stochastic gradient descent**, and it works amazingly well in practice."

    "This formula seems perhaps unintuitive and rather complicated. However, it is actually quite intuitive once you understand a few concepts.\n",

    "$$\\log\\frac{1}{p_c(x;W)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "is called the *surprise* that we should experience when seeing a label $y=c$. \n",
    "Indeed, for example, if we see class $3$ and the probability output by the network is $p_3(x;W)=1$, we are not surprised at all, as $\\log\\frac{1}{1}=\\log 1 = 0$. \n",
    "However, if the probability is only $0.01$, our surprise is $\\log\\frac{1}{0.01}=\\log 100 = 2$.\n",
    "The lower the probability, the higher the surprise. Hence, the cross-entropy above measures the *average surprise* for seeing the labeled examples in the training data. After training, the network is the least surprised possible, hopefully, which is why it is an intuitive loss function to minimize."
