    "Inverse problems are notoriously difficult, in part because they are often ill defined.\n",
    "For example, in the noiseless case, if a range sensor is 10 meters from wall, we can easily predict that the sensor reading\n",
    "will be $z = 10$.  The inverse problem is to determine something about the state of the world, given \n",
    "that the sensor measurement is $z = 10$.  This is an ill defined problem, since there are many\n",
    "possible world states that could lead to a measurement of $z=10$.\n",

    "But if you have a fever, what is the probability that you have the flu?\n",
    "The latter question is complicated by the fact that there are many possible\n",
    "causes for a fever.\n",
    "Medical doctors use the presence of fever, along with other evidence (sore throat? cough? burning eyes?),\n",
    "combined with contextual knowledge (is it flu season? has there been an outbreak of flu in the past days?).\n",
    "In other words, they perform inference by fusing multiple sources of evidence, and\n",
    "considering the context for the evidence. Bayes law, from probability theory, is the tool\n",
